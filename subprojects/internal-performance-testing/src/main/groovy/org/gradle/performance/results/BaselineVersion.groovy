/**
 * Allows comparing one Gradle version's results against another, using the Mannâ€“Whitney U test with a minimum confidence of 999%.
 *
 * We prefer the Mann-Whitney U test over Student's T test, because performance data often has a non-normal distribution.
 * Many scenarios have 2 maxima, one for a typical build and another for builds with a major GC pause.
