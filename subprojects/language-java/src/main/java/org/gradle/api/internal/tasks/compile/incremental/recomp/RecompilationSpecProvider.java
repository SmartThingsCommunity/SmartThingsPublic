 * In a typical incremental recompilation, there're three steps:
 * First, examine the incremental change files to get the classes to be recompiled: {@link #provideRecompilationSpec(CurrentCompilation, PreviousCompilation)}
 * Second, initialize the recompilation (e.g. delete stale class files and narrow down the source files to be recompiled): {@link #initializeCompilation(JavaCompileSpec, RecompilationSpec)}
 * Third, decorate the compilation result if necessary: {@link #decorateResult(RecompilationSpec, WorkResult)}, for example, notify whether current recompilation is full recompilation.
