This sample shows how to use dependencies within a JVM multi-project build in Gradle. This is the same pattern used by all JVM languages (Java, Groovy, Scala).

The `application` project has an implementation dependency on the `utilities` project:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="application/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="application/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

Which in turn has an API dependency on the `list` project:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="utilities/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="utilities/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

To build the projects, you simply need to build the application:

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew :application:run

> Task :application:run
Hello, World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
6 actionable tasks: 6 executed
