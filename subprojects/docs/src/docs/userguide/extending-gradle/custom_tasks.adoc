[[custom_tasks]]
= Developing Custom Gradle Task Types

Gradle supports two types of task. One such type is the simple task, where you define the task with an action closure. We have seen these in <<tutorial_using_tasks.adoc#tutorial_using_tasks,Build Script Basics>>. For this type of task, the action closure determines the behaviour of the task. This type of task is good for implementing one-off tasks in your build script.

The other type of task is the enhanced task, where the behaviour is built into the task, and the task provides some properties which you can use to configure the behaviour. We have seen these in <<more_about_tasks.adoc#more_about_tasks,Authoring Tasks>>. Most Gradle plugins use enhanced tasks. With enhanced tasks, you don't need to implement the task behaviour as you do with simple tasks. You simply declare the task and configure the task using its properties. In this way, enhanced tasks let you reuse a piece of behaviour in many different places, possibly across different builds.

The behaviour and properties of an enhanced task are defined by the task's class. When you declare an enhanced task, you specify the type, or class of the task.

Implementing your own custom task class in Gradle is easy. You can implement a custom task class in pretty much any language you like, provided it ends up compiled to JVM bytecode. In our examples, we are going to use Groovy as the implementation language. Groovy, Java or Kotlin are all good choices as the language to use to implement a task class, as the Gradle API has been designed to work well with these languages. In general, a task implemented using Java or Kotlin, which are statically typed, will perform better than the same task implemented using Groovy.


[[sec:packaging_a_task_class]]
== Packaging a task class

There are several places where you can put the source for the task class.

Build script::
You can include the task class directly in the build script. This has the benefit that the task class is automatically compiled and included in the classpath of the build script without you having to do anything. However, the task class is not visible outside the build script, and so you cannot reuse the task class outside the build script it is defined in.

`buildSrc` project::
You can put the source for the task class in the `__rootProjectDir__/buildSrc/src/main/groovy` directory (or `__rootProjectDir__/buildSrc/src/main/java` or `__rootProjectDir__/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin` depending on which language you prefer). Gradle will take care of compiling and testing the task class and making it available on the classpath of the build script. The task class is visible to every build script used by the build. However, it is not visible outside the build, and so you cannot reuse the task class outside the build it is defined in. Using the `buildSrc` project approach separates the task declaration — that is, what the task should do — from the task implementation — that is, how the task does it.
+
See <<organizing_gradle_projects.adoc#organizing_gradle_projects,Organizing Gradle Projects>> for more details about the `buildSrc` project.

Standalone project::
You can create a separate project for your task class. This project produces and publishes a JAR which you can then use in multiple builds and share with others. Generally, this JAR might include some custom plugins, or bundle several related task classes into a single library. Or some combination of the two.

In our examples, we will start with the task class in the build script, to keep things simple. Then we will look at creating a standalone project.

[[sec:writing_a_simple_task_class]]
== Writing a simple task class

To implement a custom task class, you extend link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.DefaultTask.html[DefaultTask].

.Defining a custom task
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/customTask/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=define-task]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/customTask/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=define-task]"]
====

This task doesn't do anything useful, so let's add some behaviour. To do so, we add a method to the task and mark it with the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskAction.html[TaskAction] annotation. Gradle will call the method when the task executes. You don't have to use a method to define the behaviour for the task. You could, for instance, call `doFirst()` or `doLast()` with a closure in the task constructor to add behaviour.

.A hello world task
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/customTask/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=add-action]"]

====

.Output of **`gradle -q hello`**
----
> gradle -q hello
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/customTask/customTaskWithAction.out[]
----

Let's add a property to the task, so we can customize it. Tasks are simply POGOs, and when you declare a task, you can set the properties or call methods on the task object. Here we add a `greeting` property, and set the value when we declare the `greeting` task.

.A customizable hello world task
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/customTaskWithProperty/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=add-property]"]

----


[[sec:custom_tasks_standalone_project]]
== A standalone project

Now we will move our task to a standalone project, so we can publish it and share it with others. This project is simply a Groovy project that produces a JAR containing the task class. Here is a simple build script for the project. It applies the Groovy plugin, and adds the Gradle API as a compile-time dependency.

.A build for a custom task

include::sample[dir="snippets/customExternalTask/groovy/task",files="build.gradle[tags=external-task-build]"]

We just follow the convention for where the source for the task class should go.

=== Example: A custom task

[[sec:using_your_task_class_in_another_project]]
=== Using your task class in another project

To use a task class in a build script, you need to add the class to the build script's classpath. To do this, you use a `buildscript { }` block, as described in <<tutorial_using_tasks.adoc#sec:build_script_external_dependencies,External dependencies for the build script>>. The following example shows how you might do this when the JAR containing the task class has been published to a local repository:

[[sec:writing_tests_for_your_task_class]]
=== Writing tests for your task class

You can use the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/testfixtures/ProjectBuilder.html[ProjectBuilder] class to create link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html[Project] instances to use when you test your task class.

=== Example: Testing a custom task

[[incremental_tasks]]
== Incremental tasks

With Gradle, it's very simple to implement a task that is skipped when all of its inputs and outputs are up to date (see <<more_about_tasks.adoc#sec:up_to_date_checks,Incremental Builds>>).
However, there are times when only a few input files have changed since the last execution, and you'd like to avoid reprocessing all of the unchanged inputs.
This can be particularly useful for a transformer task that converts input files to output files on a 1:1 basis.

If you'd like to optimize your build so that only out-of-date input files are processed, you can do so with an _incremental task_.

[NOTE]
====
There is the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/incremental/IncrementalTaskInputs.html[IncrementalTaskInputs] API, which is available in Gradle versions before 5.4.
When using link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/incremental/IncrementalTaskInputs.html[IncrementalTaskInputs], it is only possible to query for all file changes of the task inputs.
It is not possible to query for changes of individual input file properties.
Moreover, the old API does not distinguish between incremental and non-incremental task inputs, so the task itself needs to determine where the changes originated from.
Therefore, the usage of this API is deprecated, and it will be removed eventually.
The new link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html[InputChanges] API, which is documented here, replaces the old API and addresses its shortcomings.
If you need to use the old API, have a look at the documentation in the link:https://docs.gradle.org/5.3.1/userguide/custom_tasks.html#incremental_tasks[user manual for Gradle 5.3.1].
====

[[sec:implementing_an_incremental_task]]
=== Implementing an incremental task

For a task to process inputs incrementally, that task must contain an _incremental task action_.
This is a task action method that has a single link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html[InputChanges] parameter.
That parameter tells Gradle that the action only wants to process the changed inputs.
In addition, the task needs to declare at least one incremental file input property by using either link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/work/Incremental.html[@Incremental] or link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/SkipWhenEmpty.html[@SkipWhenEmpty].

[IMPORTANT]
====
To query incremental changes for an input file property, that property always needs to return the same instance.
The easiest way to accomplish this is to use one of the following types for such properties: link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/RegularFileProperty.html[RegularFileProperty], link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/DirectoryProperty.html[DirectoryProperty] or link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/ConfigurableFileCollection.html[ConfigurableFileCollection].

You can learn more about `RegularFileProperty` and `DirectoryProperty` in the <<lazy_configuration#lazy_configuration,Lazy Configuration>> chapter, especially the sections on <<lazy_configuration#lazy_properties,using read-only and configurable properties>> and <<lazy_configuration#working_with_files_in_lazy_properties,lazy file properties>>.
====

The incremental task action can use link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html#org.gradle.work.InputChanges:getFileChanges(org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection)[InputChanges.getFileChanges()] to find out what files have changed for a given file-based input property, be it of type `RegularFileProperty`, `DirectoryProperty` or `ConfigurableFileCollection`.
The method returns an `Iterable` of type link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/work/FileChange.html[FileChanges], which in turn can be queried for the following:

* the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/work/FileChange.html#getFile--[affected file]
* the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/work/FileChange.html#getChangeType--[change type] (`ADDED`, `REMOVED` or `MODIFIED`)
* the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/work/FileChange.html#getNormalizedPath--[normalized path] of the changed file
* the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/work/FileChange.html#getFileType--[file type] of the changed file

The following example demonstrates an incremental task that has a directory input.
It assumes that the directory contains a collection of text files and copies them to an output directory, reversing the text within each file.
The key things to note are the type of the `inputDir` property, its annotations, and how the action (`execute()`) uses `getFileChanges()` to process the subset of files that have actually changed since the last build.
You can also see how the action deletes a target file if the corresponding input file has been removed:

[[taskDefinition]]
.Defining an incremental task action
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=incremental-task]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=incremental-task]"]
====


If for some reason the task is executed non-incrementally, for example by running with `--rerun-tasks`, all files are reported as `ADDED`, irrespective of the previous state.
In this case, Gradle automatically removes the previous outputs, so the incremental task only needs to process the given files.

For a simple transformer task like the above example, the task action simply needs to generate output files for any out-of-date inputs and delete output files for any removed inputs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A task may only contain a single incremental task action.
====

[[sec:which_inputs_are_considered_out_of_date]]
=== Which inputs are considered out of date?

When there is a previous execution of the task, and the only changes since that execution are to incremental input file properties, then Gradle is able to determine which input files need to be processed (incremental execution).
In this case, the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html#org.gradle.work.InputChanges:getFileChanges(org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection)[InputChanges.getFileChanges()] method returns details for all input files for the given property that were _added_, _modified_ or _removed_.

However, there are many cases where Gradle is unable to determine which input files need to be processed (non-incremental execution).
Examples include:

* There is no history available from a previous execution.
* You are building with a different version of Gradle. Currently, Gradle does not use task history from a different version.
* An link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskOutputs.html#upToDateWhen-groovy.lang.Closure-[`upToDateWhen`] criterion added to the task returns `false`.
* An input property has changed since the previous execution.
* A non-incremental input file property has changed since the previous execution.
* One or more output files have changed since the previous execution.

In all of these cases, Gradle will report all input files as `ADDED` and the `getFileChanges()` method will return details for all the files that comprise the given input property.

You can check if the task execution is incremental or not with the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html#org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html##org.gradle.work.InputChanges:incremental[InputChanges.isIncremental()] method.

[[sec:an_incremental_task_in_action]]
=== An incremental task in action

Given the example incremental task implementation <<#taskDefinition,above>>, let's walk through some scenarios based on it.

First, consider an instance of `IncrementalReverseTask` that is executed against a set of inputs for the first time.
In this case, all inputs will be considered added, as shown here:

[[ex:incremental_task_definition]]
.Running the incremental task for the first time
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=reverse]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=reverse]"]

.Build layout
----
.

└── inputs

----

.Output of `gradle -q incrementalReverse`
----
> gradle -q incrementalReverse
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/incrementalTaskFirstRun.out[]
----
====

Naturally when the task is executed again with no changes, then the entire task is up to date and the task action is not executed:

.Running the incremental task with unchanged inputs
====
.Output of `gradle incrementalReverse`
----
> gradle incrementalReverse
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/incrementalTaskNoChange.out[]
----
====

When an input file is modified in some way or a new input file is added, then re-executing the task results in those files being returned by link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html#org.gradle.work.InputChanges:getFileChanges(org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection)[InputChanges.getFileChanges()].
The following example modifies the content of one file and adds another before running the incremental task:

.Running the incremental task with updated input files
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=updated-inputs]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=updated-inputs]"]

.Output of `gradle -q updateInputs incrementalReverse`
----
> gradle -q updateInputs incrementalReverse
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/incrementalTaskUpdatedInputs.out[]
----
====

NOTE: The various mutation tasks (`updateInputs`, `removeInput`, etc) are only present to demonstrate the behavior of incremental tasks.
They should not be viewed as the kinds of tasks or task implementations you should have in your own build scripts.

When an existing input file is removed, then re-executing the task results in that file being returned by link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html#org.gradle.work.InputChanges:getFileChanges(org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection)[InputChanges.getFileChanges()] as `REMOVED`.
The following example removes one of the existing files before executing the incremental task:

.Running the incremental task with an input file removed
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=removed-input]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=removed-input]"]

.Output of `gradle -q removeInput incrementalReverse`
----
> gradle -q removeInput incrementalReverse
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/incrementalTaskRemovedInput.out[]
----
====

When an _output_ file is deleted (or modified), then Gradle is unable to determine which input files are out of date.
In this case, details for _all_ the input files for the given property are returned by link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html#org.gradle.work.InputChanges:getFileChanges(org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection)[InputChanges.getFileChanges()].
The following example removes just one of the output files from the build directory, but notice how all the input files are considered to be `ADDED`:

.Running the incremental task with an output file removed
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=removed-output]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=removed-output]"]

.Output of `gradle -q removeOutput incrementalReverse`
----
> gradle -q removeOutput incrementalReverse
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/incrementalTaskRemovedOutput.out[]
----
====

The last scenario we want to cover concerns what happens when a non-file-based input property is modified.
In such cases, Gradle is unable to determine how the property impacts the task outputs, so the task is executed non-incrementally.
This means that _all_ input files for the given property are returned by link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html#org.gradle.work.InputChanges:getFileChanges(org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection)[InputChanges.getFileChanges()] and they are all treated as `ADDED`.
The following example sets the project property `taskInputProperty` to a new value when running the `incrementalReverse` task and that project property is used to initialize the task's `inputProperty` property, as you can see in the <<ex:incremental_task_definition,first example of this section>>.
Here's the output you can expect in this case:

.Running the incremental task with an input property changed
====
.Output of `gradle -q -PtaskInputProperty=changed incrementalReverse`
----
> gradle -q -PtaskInputProperty=changed incrementalReverse
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/incrementalTask/incrementalTaskChangedProperty.out[]
----
====

[[sec:storing_incremental_task_state]]
=== Storing incremental state for cached tasks

Using Gradle's `InputChanges` is not the only way to create tasks that only work on changes since the last execution.
Tools like the Kotlin compiler provide incrementality as a built-in feature.
The way this is typically implemented is that the tool stores some analysis data about the state of the previous execution in some file.
If such state files are <<build_cache.adoc#sec:task_output_caching_inputs,relocatable>>, then they can be declared as outputs of the task.
This way when the task's results are loaded from cache, the next execution can already use the analysis data loaded from cache, too.

However, if the state files are non-relocatable, then they can't be shared via the build cache.
Indeed, when the task is loaded from cache, any such state files must be cleaned up to prevent stale state from confusing the tool during the next execution.
Gradle can ensure such stale files are removed if they are declared via link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskLocalState.html#register-java.lang.Object++...++-[task.localState.register()] or if a property is marked with the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/LocalState.html[@LocalState] annotation.

[[sec:declaring_and_using_command_line_options]]
== Declaring and Using Command Line Options

Sometimes a user wants to declare the value of an exposed task property on the command line instead of the build script. Being able to pass in property values on the command line is particularly helpful if they change more frequently. The task API supports a mechanism for marking a property to automatically generate a corresponding command line parameter with a specific name at runtime.

[[sec:declaring_task_option]]
=== Declaring a command-line option

Exposing a new command line option for a task property is straightforward. You just have to annotate the corresponding setter method of a property with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/options/Option.html[Option]. An option requires a mandatory identifier. Additionally, you can provide an optional description. A task can expose as many command line options as properties available in the class.

Let's have a look at an example to illustrate the functionality. The custom task `UrlVerify` verifies whether a given URL can be resolved by making a HTTP call and checking the response code. The URL to be verified is configurable through the property `url`. The setter method for the property is annotated with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/options/Option.html[@Option].

=== Example: Declaring a command line option

[source.multi-language-sample,java]
.UrlVerify.java
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/commandLineOption/stringOption/groovy/buildSrc/src/main/java/UrlVerify.java[tag=custom-task-implementation]
----

All options declared for a task can be <<#sec:listing_task_options,rendered as console output>> by running the `help` task and the `--task` option.

[[sec:using_task_option_command_line]]
=== Using an option on the command line

Using an option on the command line has to adhere to the following rules:

- The option uses a double-dash as prefix e.g. `--url`. A single dash does not qualify as valid syntax for a task option.
- The option argument follows directly after the task declaration e.g. `verifyUrl --url=http://www.google.com/`.
- Multiple options of a task can be declared in any order on the command line following the task name.

Getting back to the previous example, the build script creates a task instance of type `UrlVerify` and provides a value from the command line through the exposed option.

.Using a command line option

----

[[sec:supported_task_option_data_types]]
=== Supported data types for options

Gradle limits the set of data types that can be used for declaring command line options. The use on the command line differ per type.

`boolean`, `Boolean`, `Property<Boolean>`::
Describes an option with the value `true` or `false`. Passing the option on the command line treats the value as `true`. For example `--enabled` equates to `true`. The absence of the option uses the default value of the property.

`String`, `Property<String>`::
Describes an option with an arbitrary String value. Passing the option on the command line also requires a value e.g. `--container-id=2x94held` or `--container-id 2x94held`.

`enum`, `Property<enum>`::
Describes an option as an enumerated type. Passing the option on the command line also requires a value e.g. `--log-level=DEBUG` or `--log-level debug`. The value is not case sensitive.

`List<String>`, `List<enum>`::
Describes an option that can takes multiple values of a given type. The values for the option have to be provided as multiple declarations e.g. `--image-id=123 --image-id=456`. Other notations such as comma-separated lists or multiple values separated by a space character are currently not supported.

[[sec:documenting_available_task_option_values]]
=== Documenting available values for an option

In theory, an option for a property type `String` or `List<String>` can accept any arbitrary value. Expected values for such an option can be documented programmatically with the help of the annotation link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/options/OptionValues.html[OptionValues]. This annotation may be assigned to any method that returns a `List` of one of the supported data types. In addition, you have to provide the option identifier to indicate the relationship between option and available values.

[NOTE]
====
Passing a value on the command line that is not supported by the option does not fail the build or throw an exception. You'll have to implement custom logic for such behavior in the task action.
====

This example demonstrates the use of multiple options for a single task. The task implementation provides a list of available values for the option `output-type`.

=== Example: Declaring available values for an option

[source.multi-language-sample,java]
.UrlProcess.java
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/commandLineOption/optionValues/groovy/buildSrc/src/main/java/UrlProcess.java[tag=custom-task-implementation]
----

[[sec:listing_task_options]]
=== Listing command line options

Command line options using the annotations link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/options/Option.html[Option] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/options/OptionValues.html[OptionValues] are self-documenting. You will see <<#sec:declaring_task_option,declared options>> and their <<#sec:documenting_available_task_option_values,available values>> reflected in the console output of the `help` task. The output renders options in alphabetical order.

=== Example: Listing available values for option

.Output of **`gradle -q help --task processUrl`**
----
> gradle -q help --task processUrl
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tasks/commandLineOption/optionValues/helpTaskOptions.out[]
----

=== Limitations

Support for declaring command line options currently comes with a few limitations.

- Command line options can only be declared for custom tasks via annotation. There's no programmatic equivalent for defining options.
- Options cannot be declared globally e.g. on a project-level or as part of a plugin.
- When assigning an option on the command line then the task exposing the option needs to be spelled out explicitly e.g. `gradle check --tests abc` does not work even though the `check` task depends on the `test` task.

[[worker_api]]
== The Worker API

[NOTE]
====

The Worker API is an <<feature_lifecycle.adoc#feature_lifecycle,incubating>> feature.

====

As can be seen from the discussion of <<#incremental_tasks,incremental tasks>>, the work that a task performs can be viewed as discrete units (i.e. a subset of inputs that are transformed to a certain subset of outputs). Many times, these units of work are highly independent of each other, meaning they can be performed in any order and simply aggregated together to form the overall action of the task. In a single threaded execution, these units of work would execute in sequence, however if we have multiple processors, it would be desirable to perform independent units of work concurrently. By doing so, we can fully utilize the available resources at build time and complete the activity of the task faster.

The Worker API provides a mechanism for doing exactly this. It allows for safe, concurrent execution of multiple items of work during a task action. But the benefits of the Worker API are not confined to parallelizing the work of a task. You can also configure a desired level of isolation such that work can be executed in an isolated classloader or even in an isolated process. Furthermore, the benefits extend beyond even the execution of a single task. Using the Worker API, Gradle can begin to execute tasks in parallel by default. In other words, once a task has submitted its work to be executed asynchronously, and has exited the task action, Gradle can then begin the execution of other independent tasks in parallel, even if those tasks are in the same project.

[[using-the-worker-api]]
=== Using the Worker API

In order to submit work to the Worker API, two things must be provided: an implementation of the unit of work, and the parameters for the unit of work.

The parameters for the unit of work are defined as an interface or abstract class that implements link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkParameters.html[WorkParameters].
The parameters type must be a <<custom_gradle_types.adoc#managed_types,managed type>>.

You can find out more about implementing work parameters in <<custom_gradle_types.adoc#custom_gradle_types,Developing Custom Gradle Types>>.

The implementation is a class that extends link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkAction.html[WorkAction]. This class should be abstract and should not implement the `getParameters()` method. Gradle will inject an implementation of this method at runtime with the parameters object for each unit of work.

A `WorkAction` implementation can inject services that provide capabilities during work execution, such as the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/FileSystemOperations.html[FileSystemOperations] service in the example above.  See <<custom_gradle_types.adoc#service_injection,Service Injection>> for further information on injecting service types.

In order to submit the unit of work, it is necessary to first acquire the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html[WorkerExecutor]. To do this, a task should have a constructor annotated with `javax.inject.Inject` that accepts a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html[WorkerExecutor] parameter. Gradle will inject the instance of link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html[WorkerExecutor] at runtime when the task is created.  Then a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkQueue.html[WorkQueue] object can be created and individual items of work can be submitted.

====

Once all of the work for a task action has been submitted, it is safe to exit the task action. The work will be executed asynchronously and in parallel (up to the setting of `max-workers`). Of course, any tasks that are dependent on this task (and any subsequent task actions of this task) will not begin executing until all of the asynchronous work completes. However, other independent tasks that have no relationship to this task can begin executing immediately.

If any failures occur while executing the asynchronous work, the task will fail and a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutionException.html[WorkerExecutionException] will be thrown detailing the failure for each failed work item. This will be treated like any failure during task execution and will prevent any dependent tasks from executing.

In some cases, however, it might be desirable to wait for work to complete before exiting the task action. This is possible using the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkQueue.html#await--[WorkQueue.await()] method. As in the case of allowing the work to complete asynchronously, any failures that occur while executing an item of work will be surfaced as a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutionException.html[WorkerExecutionException] thrown from the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkQueue.html#await--[WorkQueue.await()] method.

[NOTE]
====

Note that Gradle will only begin running other independent tasks in parallel when a task has exited a task action and returned control of execution to Gradle. When link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkQueue.html#await--[WorkQueue.await()] is used, execution does not leave the task action. This means that Gradle will not allow other tasks to begin executing and will wait for the task action to complete before doing so.

[[isolation-modes]]
=== Isolation Modes

Gradle provides three isolation modes that can be configured when creating a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkQueue.html[WorkQueue] and are specified using the one of the following methods on link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html[WorkerExecutor]:

link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html#noIsolation--[WorkerExecutor.noIsolation()]::
This states that the work should be run in a thread with a minimum of isolation. For instance, it will share the same classloader that the task is loaded from. This is the fastest level of isolation.
link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html#classLoaderIsolation-org.gradle.api.Action-[WorkerExecutor.classLoaderIsolation()]::
This states that the work should be run in a thread with an isolated classloader. The classloader will have the classpath from the classloader that the unit of work implementation class was loaded from as well as any additional classpath entries added through link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/ClassLoaderWorkerSpec.html#getClasspath--[ClassLoaderWorkerSpec.getClasspath()].
link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html#processIsolation-org.gradle.api.Action-[WorkerExecutor.processIsolation()]::
This states that the work should be run with a maximum level of isolation by executing the work in a separate process. The classloader of the process will use the classpath from the classloader that the unit of work was loaded from as well as any additional classpath entries added through link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/ClassLoaderWorkerSpec.html#getClasspath--[ClassLoaderWorkerSpec.getClasspath()]. Furthermore, the process will be a _Worker Daemon_ which will stay alive and can be reused for future work items that may have the same requirements. This process can be configured with different settings than the Gradle JVM using link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/ProcessWorkerSpec.html#forkOptions-org.gradle.api.Action-[ProcessWorkerSpec.forkOptions(org.gradle.api.Action)].



[[worker-daemons]]
=== Worker Daemons

When using `processIsolation()`, gradle will start a long-lived _Worker Daemon_ process that can be reused for future work items.

include::sample[dir="snippets/workerApi/workerDaemon/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=worker-daemon]"]
====

When a unit of work for a Worker Daemon is submitted, Gradle will first look to see if a compatible, idle daemon already exists. If so, it will send the unit of work to the idle daemon, marking it as busy. If not, it will start a new daemon. When evaluating compatibility, Gradle looks at a number of criteria, all of which can be controlled through link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/ProcessWorkerSpec.html#forkOptions-org.gradle.api.Action-[ProcessWorkerSpec.forkOptions(org.gradle.api.Action)].

executable::
A daemon is considered compatible only if it uses the same java executable.
classpath::
A daemon is considered compatible if its classpath contains all of the classpath entries requested. Note that a daemon is considered compatible only if the classpath exactly matches the requested classpath.
heap settings::
A daemon is considered compatible if it has at least the same heap size settings as requested. In other words, a daemon that has higher heap settings than requested would be considered compatible.
jvm arguments::
A daemon is considered compatible if it has set all of the jvm arguments requested. Note that a daemon is considered compatible if it has additional jvm arguments beyond those requested (except for arguments treated specially such as heap settings, assertions, debug, etc).
system properties::
A daemon is considered compatible if it has set all of the system properties requested with the same values. Note that a daemon is considered compatible if it has additional system properties beyond those requested.
environment variables::
A daemon is considered compatible if it has set all of the environment variables requested with the same values. Note that a daemon is considered compatible if it has more environment variables in addition to those requested.
bootstrap classpath::
A daemon is considered compatible if it contains all of the bootstrap classpath entries requested. Note that a daemon is considered compatible if it has more bootstrap classpath entries in addition to those requested.
debug::
A daemon is considered compatible only if debug is set to the same value as requested (true or false).
enable assertions::
A daemon is considered compatible only if enable assertions is set to the same value as requested (true or false).
default character encoding::
A daemon is considered compatible only if the default character encoding is set to the same value as requested.


Worker daemons will remain running until either the build daemon that started them is stopped, or system memory becomes scarce. When available system memory is low, Gradle will begin stopping worker daemons in an attempt to minimize memory consumption.

== Cancellation and timeouts

In order to support cancellation (e.g. when the user stops the build with CTRL+C) and task timeouts, custom tasks should react to their executing thread being interrupted.
The same is true for work items submitted via the worker API. If a task does not respond to an interrupt within 10s, the daemon will shut down in order to free up system resources.

== More details

It's often a good approach to package custom task types in a custom Gradle plugin.
The plugin can provide useful defaults and conventions for the task type, and provides a convenient way to use the task type from a build script or another plugin.
Please see <<custom_plugins.adoc#custom_plugins,Developing Custom Gradle Plugins>> for more details.

Gradle provides a number of features that are helpful when developing Gradle types, including tasks. Please see <<custom_gradle_types.adoc#,Developing Custom Gradle Types>> for more details.
