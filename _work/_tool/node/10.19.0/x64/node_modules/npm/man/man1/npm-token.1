\fBnpm token revoke <token|id>\fP:
This removes an authentication token, making it immediately unusable\. This can accept
both complete tokens (as you get back from \fBnpm token create\fP and will
find in your \fB\|\.npmrc\fP) and ids as seen in the \fBnpm token list\fP output\. 
This will NOT accept the truncated token found in \fBnpm token list\fP output\.
