.SS Description
.P
Used to manage teams in organizations, and change team memberships\. Does not
handle permissions for packages\.
.P
Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to
when operating on them, separated by a colon (\fB:\fP)\. That is, if you have a \fBwombats\fP team in a \fBwisdom\fP organization, you must always refer to that team as \fBwisdom:wombats\fP in these commands\.
.P
If you have two\-factor authentication enabled in \fBauth\-and\-writes\fP mode, then you can provide a code from your authenticator with \fB[\-\-otp <otpcode>]\fP\|\. If you don't include this then you will be prompted\.

.SS Details
.P
\fBnpm team\fP always operates directly on the current registry, configurable from
the command line using \fB\-\-registry=<registry url>\fP\|\.
.P
In order to create teams and manage team membership, you must be a \fIteam admin\fR
under the given organization\. Listing teams and team memberships may be done by
any member of the organizations\.
.P
Organization creation and management of team admins and \fIorganization\fR members
is done through the website, not the npm CLI\.
.P
To use teams to manage permissions on packages belonging to your organization,
use the \fBnpm access\fP command to grant or revoke the appropriate permissions\.
