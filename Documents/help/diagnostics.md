##Diagnostics

#### What is it For?
I have added a diagnostic function to the application to allow all device and app data to be viewed within the application and encapsulated in an easy to read format.  That can be used to help the developer troubleshoot issues. (__FYI: This will not collect any user identifiable information__)

-----------

#### 1. Viewing the Data

* Once diagnostics are enabled you will see a shortcut on the main page of the Manager App.
* Tap on the __View Diagnostics...__ shortcut
