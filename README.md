Hi,

Sorry but this is the only way I could attempt to contact you (GitHub removed messaging, can't find you anywhere else).

What happened to your Tile API repo? The one that you referenced here:

https://github.com/bachya/pytile/issues/49

But you seem to have removed it? Why is that? Do you still have it? Would you be willing to share it? Or at least give me a description of the API?

To reply you can contact me via:
