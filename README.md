They have a paddle version as well and they come with almond color plastic if you need to match.

Smart lock (probably new choices, but I'm happy with this):
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CNEE7PU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
If you get a smart lock, buy the [R Boy Apps](http://smartthings.rboyapps.com/) code to manage it.  It's really great.

In-wall relay (modify existing lights without changing switches):

Cool device used to make any appliance smart (used on my boiler and will be used on my sauna and will be used on my garage openers):

They also have a simpler MIMO with one signal in and one signal out.

Cheap cams that you can do a lot with:

[R Boy Apps](http://smartthings.rboyapps.com/) has great apps/drivers for Foscam.

Home Energy Meter:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XD8WZX6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
(Not full featured out of the box, but great data to be used how you wish.  I plan to graph it and compare to house activity, presence sensors, etc.  Using Kinesis Firehose, Kinesis Analytics, and S3 to store.)

Also, outlet devices (like the one in the SmartThings kit but also most any of them) have power meters.  So you might not use them for on/off but you can do cool things like put them on the washer and dryer and send a text when it's done, flash the lights, whatever).

Also, I recommend Phillips Hue bulbs but not for lamps and things that tend to be manually turned off.  Many of these non-Zwave devices can be integrated with SmartThings.  

I'm working on connecting a WiFi appliance that doesn't integrate (Isignia Freezer from Best Buy).  I should be able to do this by deriving the APIs from the Android mobile app.  In general, home automation is great for getting some coding going while enjoying the benefits of the work every day.
