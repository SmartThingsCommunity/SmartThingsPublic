/**
 * A container object that represents a configurable value of a specific type. A {@link Property} is also a {@link Provider} and can be used in the same way as a {@link Provider}. A property's value can be accessed using the methods of {@link Provider} such as {@link Provider#get()}. The value can be modified by using the method {@link #set(Object)} or {@link #set(Provider)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A property may be used to represent a task output. Such a property carries information about which task produces its value. When the property is attached to a task input, this allows Gradle to automatically calculate the dependencies between tasks based on the values they use as inputs and produce as outputs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>You can create a {@link Property} instance using {@link org.gradle.api.model.ObjectFactory#property(Class)}. There are also several specialized subtypes of this interface that can be created using various other factory methods.</p>
