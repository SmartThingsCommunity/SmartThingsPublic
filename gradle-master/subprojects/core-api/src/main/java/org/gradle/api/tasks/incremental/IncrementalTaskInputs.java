/**
 * Provides access to any input files that need to be processed by an incremental task.
 * <p>
 * An incremental task action is one that accepts a single {@link IncrementalTaskInputs} parameter.
 * The task can then provide an action to execute for all input files that are out of date with respect to the previous execution of the task,
 * and a separate action for all input files that have been removed since the previous execution.
 *

 *      {@literal @}TaskAction
 *      void execute(IncrementalTaskInputs inputs) {
 *          if (!inputs.incremental) {
 *              project.delete(outputDir.listFiles())

 *          }
 *      }

 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In the case where Gradle is unable to determine which input files need to be reprocessed, then all of the input files will be reported as {@link #outOfDate}.
 * Cases where this occurs include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>There is no history available from a previous execution.</li>
 *     <li>An {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskOutputs#upToDateWhen(groovy.lang.Closure)} criteria added to the task returns <code>false</code>.</li>
 *     <li>An {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.Input} property has changed since the previous execution.</li>
 *     <li>One or more output files have changed since the previous execution.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that this is a stateful API:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #outOfDate} and {@link #removed} can each only be executed a single time per {@link IncrementalTaskInputs} instance.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #outOfDate} must be executed before {@link #removed} is called.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link org.gradle.work.InputChanges} instead.
