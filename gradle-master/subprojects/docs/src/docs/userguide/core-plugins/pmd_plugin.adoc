= The PMD Plugin

The PMD plugin performs quality checks on your project's Java source files using https://pmd.github.io/[PMD] and generates reports from these checks.

[[sec:pmd_usage]]
== Usage

To use the PMD plugin, include the following in your build script:

.Using the PMD plugin

include::sample[dir="snippets/codeQuality/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=use-pmd-plugin]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/codeQuality/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=use-pmd-plugin]"]

The plugin adds a number of tasks to the project that perform the quality checks. You can execute the checks by running `gradle check`.

Note that PMD will run with the same Java version used to run Gradle.
