[[java_testing]]
= Testing in Java & JVM projects

Testing on the JVM is a rich subject matter. There are many different testing libraries and frameworks, as well as many different types of test. All need to be part of the build, whether they are executed frequently or infrequently. This chapter is dedicated to explaining how Gradle handles differing requirements between and within builds, with significant coverage of how it integrates with the two most common testing frameworks: https://junit.org/[JUnit] and https://testng.org/[TestNG].

It explains:

 * Ways to control how the tests are run (<<#sec:test_execution,Test execution>>)
 * How to select specific tests to run (<<#test_filtering,Test filtering>>)
 * What test reports are generated and how to influence the process (<<#test_reporting,Test reporting>>)
 * How Gradle finds tests to run (<<#sec:test_detection,Test detection>>)
 * How to make use of the major frameworks' mechanisms for grouping tests together (<<#test_grouping,Test grouping>>)

But first, we look at the basics of JVM testing in Gradle.

[[sec:java_testing_basics]]
== The basics

All JVM testing revolves around a single task type: link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test]. This runs a collection of test cases using any supported test library — JUnit, JUnit Platform or TestNG — and collates the results. You can then turn those results into a report via an instance of the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.TestReport.html[TestReport] task type.

In order to operate, the `Test` task type requires just two pieces of information:

 * Where to find the compiled test classes (property: link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test:testClassesDirs[Test.getTestClassesDirs()])
 * The execution classpath, which should include the classes under test as well as the test library that you're using (property: link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test:classpath[Test.getClasspath()])

When you're using a JVM language plugin — such as the <<java_plugin.adoc#java_plugin,Java Plugin>> — you will automatically get the following:

 * A dedicated `test` source set for unit tests
 * A `test` task of type `Test` that runs those unit tests

The JVM language plugins use the source set to configure the task with the appropriate execution classpath and the directory containing the compiled test classes. In addition, they attach the `test` task to the `check` <<more_about_tasks.adoc#sec:lifecycle_tasks,lifecycle task>>.

It's also worth bearing in mind that the `test` source set automatically creates <<java_plugin.adoc#java_source_set_configurations,corresponding dependency configurations>> — of which the most useful are `testImplementation` and `testRuntimeOnly` — that the plugins tie into the `test` task's classpath.

All you need to do in most cases is configure the appropriate compilation and runtime dependencies and add any necessary configuration to the `test` task. The following example shows a simple setup that uses JUnit 4.x and changes the maximum heap size for the tests' JVM to 1 gigabyte:

.A basic configuration for the 'test' task
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/basic/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=java-basic-test-config]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/basic/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=java-basic-test-config]"]
====

The link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] task has many generic configuration options as well as several framework-specific ones that you can find described in link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/junit/JUnitOptions.html[JUnitOptions], link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/junitplatform/JUnitPlatformOptions.html[JUnitPlatformOptions] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/testng/TestNGOptions.html[TestNGOptions]. We cover a significant number of them in the rest of the chapter.

If you want to set up your own `Test` task with its own set of test classes, then the easiest approach is to create your own source set and `Test` task instance, as shown in <<#sec:configuring_java_integration_tests,Configuring integration tests>>.

[[sec:test_execution]]
== Test execution

Gradle executes tests in a separate ('forked') JVM, isolated from the main build process. This prevents classpath pollution and excessive memory consumption for the build process. It also allows you to run the tests with different JVM arguments than the build is using.

You can control how the test process is launched via several properties on the `Test` task, including the following:

`maxParallelForks` — default: 1::
You can run your tests in parallel by setting this property to a value greater than 1. This may make your test suites complete faster, particularly if you run them on a multi-core CPU. When using parallel test execution, make sure your tests are properly isolated from one another. Tests that interact with the filesystem are particularly prone to conflict, causing intermittent test failures.
+
Your tests can distinguish between parallel test processes by using the value of the `org.gradle.test.worker` property, which is unique for each process. You can use this for anything you want, but it's particularly useful for filenames and other resource identifiers to prevent the kind of conflict we just mentioned.

`forkEvery` — default: 0 (no maximum)::
This property specifies the maximum number of test classes that Gradle should run on a test process before its disposed of and a fresh one created. This is mainly used as a way to manage leaky tests or frameworks that have static state that can't be cleared or reset between tests.
+
*Warning: a low value (other than 0) can severely hurt the performance of the tests*

`ignoreFailures` — default: false::
If this property is `true`, Gradle will continue with the project's build once the tests have completed, even if some of them have failed. Note that, by default, the `Test` task always executes every test that it detects, irrespective of this setting.

`failFast` —  (since Gradle 4.6) default: false::
Set this to `true` if you want the build to fail and finish as soon as one of your tests fails. This can save a lot of time when you have a long-running test suite and is particularly useful when running the build on continuous integration servers. When a build fails before all tests have run, the test reports only include the results of the tests that have completed, successfully or not.
+
You can also enable this behavior by using the `--fail-fast` command line option.

`testLogging` — default: _not set_::
This property represents a set of options that control which test events are logged and at what level. You can also configure other logging behavior via this property. See link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/logging/TestLoggingContainer.html[TestLoggingContainer] for more detail.

See link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] for details on all the available configuration options.
[NOTE]
====

The test process can exit unexpectedly if configured incorrectly. For instance, if the Java executable does not exist or an invalid JVM argument is provided, the test process will fail to start. Similarly, if a test makes programmatic changes to the test process, this can also cause unexpected failures.

For example, issues may occur if a `{javaApi}/java/lang/SecurityManager.html[SecurityManager]` is modified in a test because
Gradle's internal messaging depends on reflection and socket communication, which may be disrupted if the permissions on the security manager change. In this particular case, you should restore the original `SecurityManager` after the test so that the
gradle test worker process can continue to function.

====


[[test_filtering]]
== Test filtering

It's a common requirement to run subsets of a test suite, such as when you're fixing a bug or developing a new test case. Gradle provides two mechanisms to do this:

 * Filtering (the preferred option)
 * Test inclusion/exclusion

Filtering supersedes the inclusion/exclusion mechanism, but you may still come across the latter in the wild.

With Gradle's test filtering you can select tests to run based on:

 * A fully-qualified class name or fully qualified method name, e.g. `org.gradle.SomeTest`, `org.gradle.SomeTest.someMethod`
 * A simple class name or method name if the pattern starts with an upper-case letter, e.g. `SomeTest`, `SomeTest.someMethod` (since Gradle 4.7)
 * '*' wildcard matching

You can enable filtering either in the build script or via the `--tests` command-line option. Here's an example of some filters that are applied every time the build runs:

.Filtering tests in the build script
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/filtering/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=test-filtering]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/filtering/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=test-filtering]"]
====

For more details and examples of declaring filters in the build script, please see the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/TestFilter.html[TestFilter] reference.

The command-line option is especially useful to execute a single test method. When you use `--tests`, be aware that the inclusions declared in the build script are still honored. It is also possible to supply multiple `--tests` options, all of whose patterns will take effect. The following sections have several examples of using the command-line option.

NOTE: Not all test frameworks play well with filtering. Some advanced, synthetic tests may not be fully compatible. However, the vast majority of tests and use cases work perfectly well with Gradle's filtering mechanism.

The following two sections look at the specific cases of simple class/method names and fully-qualified names.

[[simple_name_pattern]]
=== Simple name pattern

Since 4.7, Gradle has treated a pattern starting with an uppercase letter as a simple class name, or a class name + method name. For example, the following command lines run either all or exactly one of the tests in the `SomeTestClass` test case, regardless of what  package it's in:

```
# Executes all tests in SomeTestClass
gradle test --tests SomeTestClass

# Executes a single specified test in SomeTestClass
gradle test --tests SomeTestClass.someSpecificMethod

gradle test --tests SomeTestClass.*someMethod*
```

[[full_qualified_name_pattern]]
=== Fully-qualified name pattern

Prior to 4.7 or if the pattern doesn't start with an uppercase letter, Gradle treats the pattern as fully-qualified. So if you want to use the test class name irrespective of its package, you would use `--tests *.SomeTestClass`. Here are some more examples:

```
# specific class
gradle test --tests org.gradle.SomeTestClass

# specific class and method
gradle test --tests org.gradle.SomeTestClass.someSpecificMethod

# method name containing spaces
gradle test --tests "org.gradle.SomeTestClass.some method containing spaces"

# all classes at specific package (recursively)
gradle test --tests 'all.in.specific.package*'

# specific method at specific package (recursively)
gradle test --tests 'all.in.specific.package*.someSpecificMethod'

gradle test --tests '*IntegTest'

gradle test --tests '*IntegTest*ui*'

gradle test --tests '*ParameterizedTest.foo*'

# the second iteration of a parameterized test
gradle test --tests '*ParameterizedTest.*[2]'
```

Note that the wildcard '*' has no special understanding of the '.' package separator. It's purely text based. So `--tests *.SomeTestClass` will match any package, regardless of its 'depth'.

You can also combine filters defined at the command line with <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:continuous_build, continuous build>> to re-execute a subset of tests immediately after every change to a production or test source file. The following executes all tests in the 'com.mypackage.foo' package or subpackages whenever a change triggers the tests to run:

```
gradle test --continuous --tests "com.mypackage.foo.*"
```

[[test_reporting]]
== Test reporting

The `Test` task generates the following results by default:

 * An HTML test report
 * XML test results in a format compatible with the Ant JUnit report task — one that is supported by many other tools, such as CI servers
 * An efficient binary format of the results used by the `Test` task to generate the other formats

In most cases, you'll work with the standard HTML report, which automatically includes the results from _all_ your `Test` tasks, even the ones you explicitly add to the build yourself. For example, if you add a `Test` task for integration tests, the report will include the results of both the unit tests and the integration tests if both tasks are run.

Unlike with many of the testing configuration options, there are several project-level <<java_plugin.adoc#sec:java_convention_properties,convention properties that affect the test reports>>. For example, you can change the destination of the test results and reports like so:

.Changing the default test report and results directories
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/customDirs/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=custom-report-dirs]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/customDirs/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=custom-report-dirs]"]
====

.Output of **`gradle -q showDirs`**
----
> gradle -q showDirs
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/java/customDirs/javaCustomReportDirs.out[]
----

Follow the link to the convention properties for more details.

There is also a standalone link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.TestReport.html[TestReport] task type that you can use to generate a custom HTML test report. All it requires are a value for `destinationDir` and the test results you want included in the report. Here is a sample which generates a combined report for the unit tests from all subprojects:

.Creating a unit test report for subprojects
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/testReport/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=test-report]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/testReport/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=test-report]"]
====

You should note that the `TestReport` type combines the results from multiple test tasks and needs to aggregate the results of individual test classes. This means that if a given test class is executed by multiple test tasks, then the test report will include executions of that class, but it can be hard to distinguish individual executions of that class and their output.


[[sec:test_detection]]
== Test detection

By default, Gradle will run all tests that it detects, which it does by inspecting the compiled test classes. This detection uses different criteria depending on the test framework used.

For _JUnit_, Gradle scans for both JUnit 3 and 4 test classes. A class is considered to be a JUnit test if it:

 * Ultimately inherits from `TestCase` or `GroovyTestCase`
 * Is annotated with `@RunWith`
 * Contains a method annotated with `@Test` or a super class does

For _TestNG_, Gradle scans for methods annotated with `@Test`.

Note that abstract classes are not executed. In addition, be aware that Gradle scans up the inheritance tree into jar files on the test classpath. So if those JARs contain test classes, they will also be run.

If you don't want to use test class detection, you can disable it by setting the `scanForTestClasses` property on link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] to `false`. When you do that, the test task uses only the `includes` and `excludes` properties to find test classes.

If `scanForTestClasses` is false and no include or exclude patterns are specified, Gradle defaults to running any class that matches the patterns `+**/*Tests.class+` and `+**/*Test.class+`, excluding those that match `+**/Abstract*.class+`.

[NOTE]
====
With http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide[JUnit Platform], only `includes` and `excludes` are used to filter test classes — `scanForTestClasses` has no effect.
====

[[test_grouping]]
== Test grouping

JUnit, JUnit Platform and TestNG allow sophisticated groupings of test methods.

JUnit 4.8 introduced the concept of categories for grouping JUnit 4 tests classes and methods.footnote:[The JUnit wiki contains a detailed description on how to work with JUnit categories: https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Categories[].] link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test:useJUnit(org.gradle.api.Action)[Test.useJUnit(org.gradle.api.Action)] allows you to specify the JUnit categories you want to include and exclude. For example, the following configuration includes tests in `CategoryA` and excludes those in `CategoryB` for the `test` task:

.JUnit Categories
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junit/categories/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=test-categories]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junit/categories/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=test-categories]"]
====

http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide[JUnit Platform] introduced http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-tagging-and-filtering[tagging] to replace categories. You can specify the included/excluded tags via link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/Test.html#useJUnitPlatform-org.gradle.api.Action-[Test.useJUnitPlatform(org.gradle.api.Action)], as follows:

.JUnit Platform Tags
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/tagging/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=test-tags]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/tagging/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=test-tags]"]
====

The TestNG framework uses the concept of test groups for a similar effect.footnote:[The TestNG documentation contains more details about test groups: http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#test-groups[].] You can configure which test groups to include or exclude during the test execution via the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test:useTestNG(org.gradle.api.Action)[Test.useTestNG(org.gradle.api.Action)] setting, as seen here:

.Grouping TestNG tests
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/testng/groups/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=test-config]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/testng/groups/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=test-config]"]
====

[[using_junit5]]
== Using JUnit 5

http://junit.org/junit5[JUnit 5] is the latest version of the well-known JUnit test framework.
Unlike its predecessor, JUnit 5 is modularized and composed of several modules:

    JUnit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage

The JUnit Platform serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM. JUnit Jupiter is the combination of the new http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests[programming model]
 and http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions[extension model] for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. JUnit Vintage provides a `TestEngine` for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based tests on the platform.

The following code enables JUnit Platform support in `build.gradle`:

.Enabling JUnit Platform to run your tests
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/jupiter/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=enabling-junit-platform]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/jupiter/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=enabling-junit-platform]"]
====

See link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/Test.html#useJUnitPlatform--[Test.useJUnitPlatform()] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
There are some known limitations of using JUnit 5 with Gradle, for example that tests in static nested classes won't be discovered and classes are still displayed by their class name instead of `@DisplayName`. These will be fixed in future version of Gradle. If you find more, please tell us at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/new
====

[[compiling_and_executing_junit_jupiter_tests]]
=== Compiling and executing JUnit Jupiter tests

To enable JUnit Jupiter support in Gradle, all you need to do is add the following dependencies:

.JUnit Jupiter dependencies
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/jupiter/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=jupiter-dependencies]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/jupiter/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=jupiter-dependencies]"]
====

You can then put your test cases into _src/test/java_ as normal and execute them with `gradle test`.

[[executing_legacy_tests_with_junit_vintage]]
=== Executing legacy tests with JUnit Vintage

If you want to run JUnit 3/4 tests on JUnit Platform, or even mix them with Jupiter tests, you should add extra JUnit Vintage Engine dependencies:

.JUnit Vintage dependencies
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/mix/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=vintage-dependencies]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/mix/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=vintage-dependencies]"]
====

In this way, you can use `gradle test` to test JUnit 3/4 tests on JUnit Platform, without the need to rewrite them.

A sample of mixed tests can be found at `samples/testing/junitplatform/mix` in the '-all' distribution of Gradle.

[[filtering_test_engine]]
=== Filtering test engine

JUnit Platform allows you to use different test engines. JUnit currently provides two `TestEngine` implementations out of the box:
https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.engine/module-summary.html[junit-jupiter-engine] and https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.vintage.engine/module-summary.html[junit-vintage-engine].
You can also write and plug in your own `TestEngine` implementation as documented https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#launcher-api-engines-custom[here].

By default, all test engines on the test runtime classpath will be used.
To control specific test engine implementations explicitly, you can add the following setting to your build script:

.Filter specific engines
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/engine/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=filter-engine]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/junitplatform/engine/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=filter-engine]"]
====

A test engine filtering sample can be found at `samples/testing/junitplatform/engine` in the '-all' distribution of Gradle.

[[test_execution_order]]
== Test execution order in TestNG

TestNG allows explicit control of the execution order of tests when you use a _testng.xml_ file. Without such a file — or an equivalent one configured by link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/testng/TestNGOptions.html#getSuiteXmlBuilder--[TestNGOptions.getSuiteXmlBuilder()] — you can't specify the test execution order. However, what you _can_ do is control whether all aspects of a test — including its associated `@BeforeXXX` and `@AfterXXX` methods, such as those annotated with `@Before/AfterClass` and `@Before/AfterMethod` — are executed before the next test starts. You do this by setting the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/testng/TestNGOptions.html#getPreserveOrder--[TestNGOptions.getPreserveOrder()] property to `true`. If you set it to `false`, you may encounter scenarios in which the execution order is something like: `TestA.doBeforeClass()` -> `TestB.doBeforeClass()` -> `TestA` tests.

While preserving the order of tests is the default behavior when directly working with _testng.xml_ files, the https://jitpack.io/com/github/cbeust/testng/master/javadoc/org/testng/TestNG.html[TestNG API] that is used by Gradle's TestNG integration executes tests in unpredictable order by default.footnote:[The TestNG documentation contains more details about test ordering when working with `testng.xml` files: http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#testng-xml[].] The ability to preserve test execution order was introduced with TestNG version 5.14.5. Setting the `preserveOrder` property to `true` for an older TestNG version will cause the build to fail.

.Preserving order of TestNG tests
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/testng/preserveorder/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=test-config]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/testng/preserveorder/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=test-config]"]
====

The `groupByInstance` property controls whether tests should be grouped by instance rather than by class. The http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#dependencies-with-annotations[TestNG documentation] explains the difference in more detail, but essentially, if you have a test method `A()` that depends on `B()`, grouping by instance ensures that each A-B pairing, e.g. `B(1)`-`A(1)`, is executed before the next pairing. With group by class, all `B()` methods are run and then all `A()` ones.

Note that you typically only have more than one instance of a test if you're using a data provider to parameterize it. Also, grouping tests by instances was introduced with TestNG version 6.1. Setting the `groupByInstances` property to `true` for an older TestNG version will cause the build to fail.

.Grouping TestNG tests by instances
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/testng/groupbyinstances/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=test-config]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/testng/groupbyinstances/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=test-config]"]
====

[[testNgParameterizedReporting]]
=== TestNG parameterized methods and reporting

TestNG supports http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#parameters[parameterizing test methods], allowing a particular test method to be executed multiple times with different inputs. Gradle includes the parameter values in its reporting of the test method execution.

Given a parameterized test method named `aTestMethod` that takes two parameters, it will be reported with the name `aTestMethod(toStringValueOfParam1, toStringValueOfParam2)`. This makes it easy to identify the parameter values for a particular iteration.


[[sec:configuring_java_integration_tests]]
== Configuring integration tests

A common requirement for projects is to incorporate integration tests in one form or another. Their aim is to verify that the various parts of the project are working together properly. This often means that they require special execution setup and dependencies compared to unit tests.

The simplest way to add integration tests to your build is by taking these steps:

 1. Create a new <<building_java_projects.adoc#sec:java_source_sets,source set>> for them
 2. Add the dependencies you need to the appropriate configurations for that source set
 3. Configure the compilation and runtime classpaths for that source set
 4. Create a task to run the integration tests

You may also need to perform some additional configuration depending on what form the integration tests take. We will discuss those as we go.

Let's start with a practical example that implements the first three steps in a build script, centered around a new source set `intTest`:

.Setting up working integration tests
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/basic/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=practical-integ-test-source-set]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/basic/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=practical-integ-test-source-set]"]
====

This will set up a new source set called `intTest` that automatically creates:

 * `intTestImplementation`, `intTestCompileOnly`, `intTestRuntimeOnly` configurations (and <<java_plugin.adoc#java_source_set_configurations, a few others>> that are less commonly needed)
 * A `compileIntTestJava` task that will compile all the source files under _src/intTest/java_

The example also does the following, not all of which you may need for your specific integration tests:

 * Adds the production classes from the `main` source set to the compilation and runtime classpaths of the integration tests — `sourceSets.main.output` is a <<working_with_files.adoc#sec:file_collections,file collection>> of all the directories containing compiled production classes and resources
 * Makes the `intTestImplementation` configuration extend from `implementation`, which means that all the declared dependencies of the production code also become dependencies of the integration tests
 * Does the same for the `intTestRuntimeOnly` configuration

In most cases, you want your integration tests to have access to the classes under test, which is why we ensure that those are included on the compilation and runtime classpaths in this example. But some types of test interact with the production code in a different way. For example, you may have tests that run your application as an executable and verify the output. In the case of web applications, the tests may interact with your application via HTTP. Since the tests don't need direct access to the classes under test in such cases, you don't need to add the production classes to the test classpath.

Another common step is to attach all the unit test dependencies to the integration tests as well — via `intTestImplementation.extendsFrom testImplementation` — but that only makes sense if the integration tests require _all_ or nearly all the same dependencies that the unit tests have.

There are a couple of other facets of the example you should take note of:

 * `+=` allows you to append paths and collections of paths to `compileClasspath` and `runtimeClasspath` instead of overwriting them
 * If you want to use the convention-based configurations, such as `intTestImplementation`, you _must_ declare the dependencies _after_ the new source set

Creating and configuring a source set automatically sets up the compilation stage, but it does nothing with respect to running the integration tests. So the last piece of the puzzle is a custom test task that uses the information from the new source set to configure its runtime classpath and the test classes:

.Defining a working integration test task
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/basic/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=integ-test-task]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/basic/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=integ-test-task]"]
====

Again, we're accessing a source set to get the relevant information, i.e. where the compiled test classes are — the `testClassesDirs` property — and what needs to be on the classpath when running them — `classpath`.

Users commonly want to run integration tests after the unit tests, because they are often slower to run and you want the build to fail early on the unit tests rather than later on the integration tests. That's why the above example adds a `shouldRunAfter()` declaration. This is preferred over `mustRunAfter()` so that Gradle has more flexibility in executing the build in parallel.

[[sec:skipping_java_tests]]
== Skipping the tests

If you want to skip the tests when running a build, you have a few options. You can either do it via <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:excluding_tasks_from_the_command_line,command line arguments>> or <<more_about_tasks.adoc#sec:skipping_tasks,in the build script>>. To do it on the command line, you can use the `-x` or `--exclude-task` option like so:

    gradle build -x test

This excludes the `test` task and any other task that it _exclusively_ depends on, i.e. no other task depends on the same task. Those tasks will not be marked "SKIPPED" by Gradle, but will simply not appear in the list of tasks executed.

Skipping a test via the build script can be done a few ways. One common approach is to make test execution conditional via the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Task.html#org.gradle.api.Task:onlyIf(org.gradle.api.specs.Spec)[Task.onlyIf(org.gradle.api.specs.Spec)] method. The following sample skips the `test` task if the project has a property called `mySkipTests`:

.Skipping the unit tests based on a project property
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/basic/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=skip-tests-condition]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/basic/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=skip-tests-condition]"]
====

In this case, Gradle will mark the skipped tests as "SKIPPED" rather than exclude them from the build.

[[sec:forcing_java_tests_to_run]]
== Forcing tests to run

In well-defined builds, you can rely on Gradle to only run tests if the tests themselves or the production code change. However, you may encounter situations where the tests rely on a third-party service or something else that might change but can't be modeled in the build.

You can force tests to run in this situation by cleaning the output of the relevant `Test` task — say `test` — and running the tests again, like so:

    gradle cleanTest test

`cleanTest` is based on a <<more_about_tasks.adoc#sec:task_rules,task rule>> provided by the <<base_plugin.adoc#sec:base_tasks,Base Plugin>>. You can use it for _any_ task.

[[sec:debugging_java_tests]]
== Debugging when running tests

On the few occasions that you want to debug your code while the tests are running, it can be helpful if you can attach a debugger at that point. You can either set the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test:debug[Test.getDebug()] property to `true` or use the `--debug-jvm` command line option.

When debugging for tests is enabled, Gradle will start the test process suspended and listening on port 5005.

You can also enable debugging in the DSL, where you can also configure other properties:

    test {
        debugOptions {
            enabled = true
            port = 4455
            server = true
            suspend = true
        }
    }

With this configuration the test JVM will behave just like when passing the `--debug-jvm` argument but it will listen on port 4455.

[[sec:java_test_fixtures]]
== Using test fixtures

=== Producing and using test fixtures within a single project

Test fixtures are commonly used to setup the code under test, or provide utilities aimed at facilitating the tests of a component.
Java projects can enable test fixtures support by applying the `java-test-fixtures` plugin, in addition to the `java` or `java-library` plugins:

.Applying the Java test fixtures plugin
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/groovy",files="lib/build.gradle[tags=use-plugin]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/kotlin",files="lib/build.gradle.kts[tags=use-plugin]"]
====

This will automatically create a `testFixtures` source set, in which you can write your test fixtures.
Test fixtures are configured so that:

- they can see the _main_ source set classes
- _test_ sources can see the _test fixtures_ classes

For example for this main class:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/acme/Person.java
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/java/fixtures/groovy/lib/src/main/java/com/acme/Person.java[tags=sample]
----

A test fixture can be written in `src/testFixtures/java`:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/testFixtures/java/com/acme/Simpsons.java
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/java/fixtures/groovy/lib/src/testFixtures/java/com/acme/Simpsons.java[tags=sample]
----

=== Declaring dependencies of test fixtures

Similarly to the link:java_library_plugin.html[Java Library Plugin], test fixtures expose an API and an implementation configuration:

.Declaring test fixture dependencies
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/groovy",files="lib/build.gradle[tags=test_fixtures_deps]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/kotlin",files="lib/build.gradle.kts[tags=test_fixtures_deps]"]
====

It's worth noticing that if a dependency is an _implementation_ dependency of test fixtures, then _when compiling tests that depend on those test fixtures_, the implementation dependencies will _not leak_ into the compile classpath.
This results in improved separation of concerns and better compile avoidance.

=== Consuming test fixtures of another project

Test fixtures are not limited to a single project.
It is often the case that a dependent project tests also needs the test fixtures of the dependency.
This can be achieved very easily using the `testFixtures` keyword:

.Adding a dependency on test fixtures of another project
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=consumer_dependencies]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=consumer_dependencies]"]
====

=== Publishing test fixtures

One of the advantages of using the `java-test-fixtures` plugin is that test fixtures are published.
By convention, test fixtures will be published with an artifact having the `test-fixtures` classifier.
For both Maven and Ivy, an artifact with that classifier is simply published alongside the regular artifacts.
However, if you use the `maven-publish` or `ivy-publish` plugin, test fixtures are published as additional variants in {metadata-file-spec}[Gradle Module Metadata] and you can directly depend on test fixtures of external libraries in another Gradle project:

.Adding a dependency on test fixtures of an external library
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=external-test-fixtures-dependency]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=external-test-fixtures-dependency]"]
====

It's worth noting that if the external project is _not_ publishing Gradle Module Metadata, then resolution will fail with an error indicating that such a variant cannot be found:

.Output of **`gradle dependencyInsight --configuration functionalTestClasspath --dependency gson`**
----
> gradle dependencyInsight --configuration functionalTestClasspath --dependency gson
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/java/fixtures/dependencyInsight.out[]
----

The error message mentions the missing `com.google.code.gson:gson-test-fixtures` capability, which is indeed not defined for this library.
That's because by convention, for projects that use the `java-test-fixtures` plugin, Gradle automatically creates test fixtures variants with a capability whose name is the name of the main component, with the appendix `-test-fixtures`.

[NOTE]
====
If you publish your library and use test fixtures, but do not want to publish the fixtures, you can deactivate publishing of the _test fixtures variants_ as shown below.
====

.Disable publishing of test fixtures variants
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/groovy/lib",files="build.gradle[tags=disable-test-fixtures-publishing]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/userguide/java/fixtures/kotlin/lib",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=disable-test-fixtures-publishing]"]
