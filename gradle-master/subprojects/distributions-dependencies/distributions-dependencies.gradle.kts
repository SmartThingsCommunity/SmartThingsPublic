/**
 * This project at the bottom of the project hierarchy enforce the "platform" for the Gradle distribution.
 * We want the versions that are packaged in the distribution to be used everywhere (e.g. in all test scenarios)
 * Hence, we lock the versions down here for all other subprojects.
 *
 * Note:
 * We use strictly here because we do not have any better means to do this at the moment.
 * Ideally we wound be able to say "lock down all the versions of the dependencies resolved for the distribution"
