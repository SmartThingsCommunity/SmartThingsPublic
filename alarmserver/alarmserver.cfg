## SmartThings Callback URL Setup: The below information will be generated by
## the smartapp, and can be retrieved in the app's settings page at the bottom
## under "Show Smartapp Token Info". The URL below often needs to be updated

## this information from the smartapp to here (e-mail it to yourself from your
## phone if need be.)

## Envisalink Host: Replace this with the hostname or IP of the EVL device
host=envisalink
## Envisalink Port: The default EVL port is 4025
port=4025
## Envisalink Password: The default EVL password is "user"
pass=user

## Envisalink Proxy: The EVL device only allows one connection at a time, and
## running alarmserver will consume that only connection. This option allows
## multiple clients to be connected to the EVL by creating a proxy. However,
## this is NOT needed by the smartapp, which only uses the httpport defined
## in the section above. This is only for connecting another client directly
## to the EVL for debugging, or for running another application like alarmserver
## application in parallel.
