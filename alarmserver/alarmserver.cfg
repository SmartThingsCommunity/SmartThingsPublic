## The server runs with SSL. You need a certificate and key
## server.crt and server.key are included but you should

## Port to run the server on

## Use a fuzzy time algorithm for displaying dates and times
## True means times will be "4 minutes ago", "3 days ago"
## False means times will be exact "Jun 21st 2013 08:00:00"

## Experimental CallbackURL functionality - Mainly for Smartthings right now
## The resulting path for callbackurls looks like this
## This likely needs to be fixed to allow more flexibility for any service?
## Suggestions welcome 
## ${callbackurl_base}/${callbackurl_app_id}/panel/${code}/${zoneorpartitionnumber}?access_token=${callbackurl_access_token}

## Smartthings or generic callback URL setup
callbackurl_base=https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations
callbackurl_app_id=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
callbackurl_access_token=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
## Define the event codes you want callbacks for, the codes below
## cover zone open/close, partition ready, not ready, armed, exit delay, entry delay and in alarm status
## these should cover most use cases
callbackurl_event_codes=510,511,601,602,603,604,605,606,609,610,620,621,622,623,624,625,626,650,651,652,653,654,655,656,657,663,664,840,841

## Define your partition(s)
## Note: For callbackURL setup only defined zones and partitions are sent callback data
## You can use regular panels or the simple panels, or both. Uncomment and adjust per
## your preference.

## Zone names. Delete the zones you're not using to have them hidden.
## Add more [zoneXX] if you need more zones
