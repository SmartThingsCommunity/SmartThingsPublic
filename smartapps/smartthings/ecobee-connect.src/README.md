## <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
This document describes the various features related to the Open Source Ecobee (Connect)  SmartApp and the related compoenents. This SmartApp suite and the related Device Handlers are intended to be used with [Ecobee thermostats](http://www.ecobee.com/) with the [SmartThings](https://www.smartthings.com/) platform. 

The following components are part of the solution:
- **Ecobee (Connect) SmartApp**: This SmartApp provides a single interface for Ecobee Authorization, Device Setup (both Thermostats **and** Sensors), Behavioral Settings and even a Debug Dashboard. Additional features can be added over time as well thanks to built in support for Child SmartApps, keeping everything nicely integrated into one app.
- **ecobee Routines Child SmartApp**: Child app that lets you trigger settings changes on your Ecobee thermostats based on the SmartThings Hello Modes. Settings include the Ecobee Program (Comfort Settings), Fan Modes and Hold Types. In additional to SmartThings Hello Modes, sunrise/sunset triggers are also support. Multiple instances of the SmartApp are also supported for maximum flexibility.
- **Ecobee Thermostat Device Handler**: This implements the Device Handler for the Ecobee Thermostat functions and attributes.
- **Ecobee Sensor Device Handler**: This implements the Device Handler for the Ecobee Sensor attributes. This is also used to expose the internal sensors on the Thermostat to allow the actual temperature values (instead of only the average) to also be available. This is critically important for some applications such as smart vents.

Here are links to the working version of the repository being developed and maintained by Sean Schneyer [(on GitHub)](https://github.com/StrykerSKS) [(on SmartThings Community)](https://community.smartthings.com/users/strykersks/).

## <a name="motivation">Motivation</a>

The intent is to provide an Open Source Licensed ecobee-to-SmartThings implementation that can be used by the SmartThings community of users free of charge and without fear of the device disappearing in the future. This will help ensure accessibility for all users and provide for an easy mechanism for the community to help maintain/drive the functionality.

The ultimate goal would be to have these capabilities become part of the stock drivers on the "master" branch. But until that time they will be maintained as a fork providing good visibility to any changes upstream.

# <a name="features">Features</a>
## General
This collection of SmartApps and Device Handlers has been designed for simple installation, flexibile configuration options and easy operation. It is also extensible through the use of Child SmartApps that can easily be added to the configuration. **And it fully implements the related [SmartThings Capabilities](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/capabilities-reference.html).**

Key Highlights include:
- **Open Source Implementation!** Free as in beer AND speech. No donations or purchase needed to use.
- Single installation SmartApp, `Ecobee (Connect)` used for installing both Thermostats **and** Sensors. No need for multiple apps just for installation! In fact, the `Ecobee (Connect)` SmartApp is the only SmartApp interface you'll need to access all available functions, including those provided by Child SmartApps (if installed).
- Sophisticated User Interface: Uses custom Ecobee icons throughout the design to provide a more polished look and feel.
- Display of current weather with support for separate day and night icons (just like on the front of your Ecobee thermostat)!
- Robust watchdog handling to minimize API Connectivity issues, but also includes an API Status Tile to quickly identify if there is an ongoing problem. No more guessing if you are still connected or not.
- Included Child SmartApp (`ecobee Routines`) for automating settings changes based on SmartThings Hello Modes being activated (such as through a Routine)
- Full support for both Fahrenheit and Celsius

## <a name="features-therm-ui">Thermostat and Sensor Device User Interfaces</a>
The primary user interface on a day-to-day basis will be two different types of Device Handlers that are shown on the `Things` list under `My Home` in the mobile app. Screenshots of both the `Ecobee Thermostat` and the `Ecobee Sensor` are shown below.

## General
> **NOTE**: While I have tested this on my system and believe it to be working (and we have over 200 user now). I have not run a full battery of tests that can include all possible corner cases or configurations. It is possible, perhaps even _likely_, that there are still bugs or platform specific issues in this code. If you do run into an issue, the best option is to report it using the [Issues](https://github.com/StrykerSKS/SmartThingsPublic/issues) tab within the GitHub repository. I will do my best to quickly address any issues that are found. 

It is highly recommended that you use the GitHub Integration that SmartThings offers with their IDE. This will make it **much** easier to keep up to date with changes over time. For the general steps needed for setting up GitHub IDE integration, please visit <http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/tools-and-ide/github-integration.html> and follow the steps for performing the setup.

## Install Preparation
The first step is to ensure that you delete any existing Ecobee related devices and SmartApps that you may have from other sources. They are likely not compatible with this codebase and are almost certain to cause problems down the road. 

If you are not familiar with adding your own custom devices, then be sure to familiarize yourself with the [SmartThings IDE](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/) before you begin the installation process.

You will also need to make sure that you remember your Ecobee username and password. You should login to <http://www.ecobee.com/> now to ensure you have your credentials.

## <a name="install-smartapp-phone">Install and Run `Ecobee (Connect) `SmartApp on Phone/Tablet</a>
> **NOTE**: I have only tested this on an iPhone 6 as I do not have access to Android device. Feedback and bug reports are welcome if any issues are found on any platform. There are already some known issues with platforms behaving differently due to differences in the SmartThings apps on those platforms.

The SmartApp will guide you through the basic installation and setup process. It includes the following aspects:
- Authentication with Ecobee to allow API Calls for your thermostat(s) (and connected sensors)
- Discover and selection of Thermostats
- Discover and selection of Remote Sensors (if there are any)
- Setup of option features/parameters such as Smart Auto Temp Control, Polling Intervals, etc

Follow these steps for the SmartApp on your mobile device:
- Open the SmartThings app
- Open the `Marketplace`
- Click the `SmartApps` tab
- Select `My Apps` (all the way at the bottom of the list)
- Click `Ecobee (Connect)` (NOTE: If the app simply returns back to the `My Apps` screen try clicking again. If this still does not work after several tries, please verify all install steps from above are completed.)
- Click (as indicated on the screen) to enter your Ecobee Credentials
- Enter your Ecobee Email and Password
- Click `Accept`
- You should receive a message indicating `Your ecobee Account is now connected to SmartThings!`
- Click `Done` (or `Next` depending on your device OS)
- Click `Done` (or `Next` depending on your device OS) again to save the credentials and prepare for the next steps.
- You should receive a small green popup at the top stating "`Ecobee (Connect) is now installed and automating`"
- Go to the `My Home` screen and slect the `SmartApps` tab
- Click on the `Ecobee (Connect)` SmartApp
- Work through the various option screens to select thermostats and sensors. (NOTE: The options are dynamic and will change/appear based on other selections such as selecting a thermostat will reveal the sensors option screen.)
- You can also go into the `Preferences` section to set various preferences such as `Hold Type`, `Smart Auto Temperature`, `Polling Interval`, `Debug Level`, and wether to create separate sensor objects for thermostats.
- After making all selections, Click `Done` to save your preferences and exit the SmartApp

At this point, the SmartApp will automatically create all of the new devices, one for each thermostat and sensor. These will show up in your regular `Things` list within the app. 

> **NOTE 1**: It may take a few minutes for the new devices to show up in the list. You should try refreshing the list if they are not there (pull down on the list). In extreme cases, you may have to restart the SmartThings app on your phone to update the list. You should only have to do this once.

<br/>

> **NOTE 2**: If you uninstall the SmartApp it will automatically remove all of the thermostats and sensors that it previously installed. This is necessary (and expected) as those devices are "children" of the SmartApp.

<br/>

> There is currently a lot of debug information that can be generated from the app (which is configurable). If you need to do any kind of troubleshooting, you can see the current information flowing through in the `Live Logging` tab of the SmartThings IDE. You will also need this information if you open an `Issue` since it will be needed to track down what is going on. ** Please ensure that you do not include any personal information from the logs in an `Issue` report. **

-------------------------
## Updating
If you have enabled GitHub integration with the SmartThings IDE, then updates are a breeze. Otherwise the steps are a bit more manual but not too complicated.

### Updating with GitHub Integration
The IDE provides visual cues to alert you that any device types or SmartApps have been updated in their upstream repositories. See the [GitHub/IDE integration guide](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/tools-and-ide/github-integration.html) for more details on the different colors.

Once you have determined that an update is available, follow these steps:
- Login to the SmartThings IDE
- Go to either the `My Device Handlers` or `My SmartApps` tabs to see if there are updates (the color of the item will be purple)
- Click the `Update from Repo` button (top right)
- Select the repository and branch you want to update `SmartThingsPublic (StrykerSKS-Ecobee3)`
- The item should show up in the `Obsolete (updated in GitHub)` column and automatically be selected
- Select `Publish` (bottom right)
- Click `Execute Update` (bottom right)
- You should receive a confirmation message such as this example: `Updated 1 and created 0 SmartApps, 1 published`
- (Optional, but recommended) Rerun the `Ecobee (Connect)` SmartApp. This seems to eleviate any residual issues that may occur due to the update

You should now be running on the updated code. Be sure that you check for both updates of the SmartApp **and** the Device Type. Updating one but not the other could cause compatibility problems.

### Updating manually (without GitHub Integration)

To update manually, you will need to "cut & paste" the raw code from GitHub into the SmartThings IDE, Save and Publish the code. I will leave it to the reader to work through the full individual steps, but the links to the code are the same as those that were used during the initial install process.

-------------------------
## Troubleshooting

| Symptom 	| Possible Solution 	|
|---------	|-------------------	|
| The devices are not showing up in the Things tab after installation    	|  It can take several minutes for things to show up properly. If you don't want to wait then simply kill the SmartThings app and reload it.              	|
| Receive error similar to "error java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot get property 'authorities' on null object"        	| This indicates that you have not turned on OAuth for the SmartApp. Please review the installation instructions and complete the OAuth steps.                  	|
| Irregular behavior after an update to the SmartApp or Device Handler code| It is possible that after updating the codebase that you may experience strange behavior, including possible app crashes. This seems to be a general issue with updates on SmartThings. Try the following steps: <br/> 1) Re-run the `Ecobee (Connect)` SmartApp to re-initialize the devices <br/> 2) If that does not solve the problem, remove and re-install the SmartApp |
|         	|                   	|
|         	|                   	|



### Debug Level in SmartApp
The `Ecobee (Connect)` SmartApp allows the end user to config the Debug Level they wish to use (ranging from 1-5). The higher the level the more debug information is fed into the `Live Logging` on the SmartThings IDE.

Also, if a user chooses Debug Level 5, then a new `Debug Dashboard` will appear within the SmartApp. This dashboard gives direct access to various state information of the app as well as a few helper functions that can be used to manaually trigger actions that are normally timer based.

### Live Logging on IDE
The `Live Logging` feature on the SmartThings IDE is an essential tool in the debugging process of any issues that may be encountered.

To access the `Live Logging` feature, follow these steps:
- Go the SmartThings IDE (<https://graph.api.smartthings.com/>) and log in
- click `Live Logging`

### Installed SmartApps Info on IDE
The SmartThings IDE also provides helpful insights related to the current state of any SmartApp running on the system. To access this information, follow the follwing steps:
- Go the SmartThings IDE (<https://graph.api.smartthings.com/>) and log in
- Click `My Locations` (select your location if you have more than one)
- Scroll down and click `List SmartApps`
- Find the `Ecobee (Connect)` SmartApp and click the link
