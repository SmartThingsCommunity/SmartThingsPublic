# Ecobee (Connect) and Ecobee Device Handlers Change Log

Notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project is in a pre-1.0 state. This means that its APIs and behavior are subject to breaking changes without deprecation notices. However, all due efforts will be made to warn the user. Until 1.0, version numbers will follow a [Semver][]-ish `0.y.z` format, where `y` is incremented when new features or breaking changes are introduced, and `z` is incremented for lesser changes or bug fixes.


## [Beta][] (Ongoing)
* Follow the link to see the comparison between the stable release and the beta branch (`StrykerSKS-enhanced-ecobee`)

## [Alpha][] (Ongoing)
* Follow the link to see the comparison between the stable release and the beta branch (`StrykerSKS-enhanced-ecobee`)
* **NOTE: This is my active development branch. Things on this branch are very likely to break at random times. Provided for informational purposes only!**


## [0.9.0-RC6][] (2016-02-01) **(Beta Release)**
### General Changes
* 3 changed files with 876 additions and 467 deletions (To be updated)
* Introduction of support for Child SmartApps! First SmartApp is `ecobee Routines` for using SmartThings Modes (Routines) to control the modes (and other settings) on the Ecobee Thermostats
* More hooks to be defensive against the SmartThings platform stability issues (e.g. Scheduled Events)

### SmartApp Changes
#### **NEW** ecobee Routines Child SmartApp
* Control your Ecobee Thermostats based on SmartThings Modes/Routines
* Support for multiple instances for running different options at different modes
* Support for controlling the following options per instance:
  * Multiple SmartThings Modes
  * Multiple Thermostats
  * Select Ecobee Program to run (Away, Home, Sleep or Resume Program) (NOTE: Custom programs are on the wish list for a future release)
  * Select Fan Mode (Optional)
  * Can also be run at Sunrise and/or Sunset event (Optional)
  * Toggle to temporarily disable the Handler so you don't have to delete it when you want it off temporarily

#### Ecobee (Connect)
* Complete overhaul of the Ecobee (Connect) User Interface to make it easier to manage and to allow for the introduction of the Child SmartApps
* Switched from using `atomicState` to just `state` to reduce overhead
* Using helper functions to build JSON bodies for API requests. This should spead up adding new features over time
* Added checks to make sure the customer Device Handlers are installed before proceeding with setup
* Added a `Debug Dashboard` so that various state variables and functions can be performed right from within the SmartApp. No need to go the IDE just to check things!
* Added some watchdog capabilities to improve reliability of Scheduled Events
* Updated the fan mode handling to not disrupt the existing running event (hold) or program, only changes the fan settings now
* Set several helper function to `private` so as to not pollute the exposed interfaces
* Thermostats can now also be exposed as individual Remote Sensors so that the actual temperature at the Thermostat can be used for HA

### Device Handler Changes
* [Thermostat] Faster response in User Interface (send events immediately when a change is made in app)
* [Thermostat] Defaulting back to the thermostat `multiAttributeTile` with the release of the 2.0.8 phone apps (Needs Android testing!)

## [0.8.0][] (2016-01-28)
*  4 changed files with 469 additions and 932 deletions
*  Support for `setThermostatFanMode` handling to set the fan modes
*  Fan Modes Implemented:
 *  "on", "off", "auto": full support
 *  "circulate": Partially implemented, currently just calls `auto()`
*  Added a button for changing the fan between "auto" and "on" on the Thermostat Tile
*  Continued code refactoring
*  Changed holdType labels to "Until I Change" and "Until Next Program" to better align with the Ecobee terms

## [0.7.5][] (2016-01-25)

### General Changes
* First tagged release
* Added support for different debug levels. This should make it easier to thin out the logs to see real errors instead of all the trace information
* Total of 3 changed files with 889 additions and 454 deletions

### SmartApp Changes
* Added support for Comfort Settings
* Tweeks to the handling for API connection errors in an attempt to recover a connection
* Fixes for handling an offline Remote Sensor (due to range, battery, etc)
* Refactoring of code to simplify maintenance (this will be an ongoing process for the next several releases)
* Added support for Ecobee Events to read the current state. This means we can now show status for Manual and Automatic "Holds" that are running including `Smart Home` and `Smart Away`
* Clear the waittime between polls immediately after making changes to the settings. This allows the `refresh` button to be more responsive. 

### Device Handler Changes
* [Thermostat] Added support for Comfort Settings (programs). Adds the following new commands (can be invoked by other SmartApps):
  * setThermostatProgram(program, holdType)
  * home()
  * sleep()
  * away()
* [Thermostat] Added the corresponding Tiles to support manipulating and viewing the Comfort Settings. (NOTE: UI elements are likely to change in the future once the overall development stabalizes)
* [Remote Sensor] Added state for an offline sensor. Marks the `motion` tile to indicate the failure
