HouseMap is a project designed to create a static control center for your SmartHome
It requires a personally hosted website and a working knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, and Groovy to implement
This initial release is to share with coders my work to date. The code is self documenting to some degree.
For this to work you will need to install the .css, .js, and .php files on your own personally hosted website
then you can install the .groovy SmartApp


/*
* House Controller web service PHP application for SmartThings
* author: Ken Washington  (c) 2016
*
* general purpose routines included for authorizing a web service
* specific application shows all switches, motion sensors, and door contacts
* thermostats and doors to open and other capabilities will be added later
* uses Ajax to query specific sensor to return most recent 20 historical events
*
* for switches the Ajax call is used to turn the switch on and off from the web
* DEBUG flags can be used to show specific data details during installation
* this must be paired with a SmartApp on the SmartThings side
* and the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET must match what is specified here
* to do this you must enable OAUTH2 in the SmartApp panel within SmartThings
*
* The endpoints must also match the names referenced in the routines below
* they are:
*   /sensors     for motion sensors
*   /contacts    for door contacts
*   /switches    for on/off switches including lights and dimmers
*   /onecontact  for returning the history of door contact things
*   /onemotion   for returning the history of motion sensors
*   /setswitch   for turning the switch on and off
*
* Other requirements for using this web app include installing jquery and pointing to it
* the references below are the directories that I use on my server but they can be anything
* you can even point it to the code.jquery site but I didn't like the delay and security risk
* 
* Finally, install this file and the accompanying .js and .css file on your server
* and you should be good to go. Don't forget to provide the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET info
*
