/**
 *     Smarter garage door button with integrated sensor
 *     modified from Lights Off, When Closed
 *     implements a virtual switch that ties momentary to sensor
 *     based on the opening or closing of the contact sensor
 *     the door status is kept up to date and does the right thing
 *     so that when you say close it closes and open it opens
 *     if the door is already closed, and you pick close nothing happens
 *     likewise if it is already opened and you pick open nothing happens
 *     the only thing that doesn't work is to stop the garage in mid stream
 * 
 * Modified by Ken Washington to work with any switch and to ensure it goes off
