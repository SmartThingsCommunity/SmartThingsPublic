A TDS Sensor can detect changes in your home water supply but this sensor should not be relied on as a sole source of water quality. There are several harmful items in water a TDS sensor cannot detect. Although we have worked hard to make this sensor reliable, it or the network it is connected to may malfunction and give false readings."
