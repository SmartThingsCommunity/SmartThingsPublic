 *  Better Double Tap
 *
 *  A couple important notes about this app:  
 *
 *      * First, this app expects that you are using a switch that will send on/off events even when the switch state
 *        is not changing.  For example, the first press turns the main lights on and sends an "on" event, but when 
 *        the second "Tap" is pressed, some switches will check the state of the switch, see that it is already on,
 *        and suppress the event.  This is no good.  In this case, you must customize your device type and look for 
 *        the variable "canBeCurrentState" (or something similar) and set it to true.  
 *
 *      * Second, due to cloud processing, the events are registered painfully slow and if you double tap too fast, 
 *        often times the second event will never even be sent.  This version of the app allows you to specify a 
 *        "window of opportunity" so-to-speak and defaults it to 10 seconds.  The original Double Tap app used 4 
 *        seconds and I just found that to be totally inadequate (unfortunately).  I would recommend setting it even
 *        higher, I personally use 30 seconds.  The presses cannot be done fast either, I would recommend pressing
 *        once, counting 2 Mississippi, and then doing the second press.  If timed correctly, it will properly turn
 *        on/off the linked devices.  This is just what we have to live with until an app like this can be processed
 *        locally rather than in the cloud.
