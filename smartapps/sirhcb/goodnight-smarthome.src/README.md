This app is designed to be run at night before heading to bed.

Please note: this app creates a virtual childDevice to act as a trigger to start the app running.  You are REQUIRED to
also install the sirhcb/on-off-button-tile.src button tile device type.  This is just a clone of the SmartThing device type with the
proper namespace to work with my app.

When installing this app will ask for:

1. A name for the trigger button
2. Your TTS device
3. Whether or not you also want push notifications
4. Which open/close sensors to monitor
5. Which lights to turn on (Optional)
6. Which lights to turn off and when (Optional)
7. Which routine to run and when (Optional)

After installing, run the app by turning on the trigger.  Then the app will will check all the doors and windows
and read off, by name, any that are left open.  If there are no windows or doors left open, the app will say:
"The house is ready for night."

Please let me know if you have any issues.  Username in the SmartThings forum is chrisb.
