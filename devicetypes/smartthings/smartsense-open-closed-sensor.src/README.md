## Device Health

A Category C2 open/closed sensor with maxReportTime of 5 mins.
Check-in interval is double the value of maxReportTime. 
This gives the device twice the amount of time to respond before it is marked as offline.
Check-in interval = 12 mins

## Battery Specification

One CR2 3V battery required.

## Troubleshooting

If the sensor doesn't pair when trying from the SmartThings mobile app, it is possible that the sensor is out of range.
Pairing needs to be tried again by placing the sensor closer to the hub.
Instructions related to pairing, resetting and removing the sensor from SmartThings can be found in the following link:
