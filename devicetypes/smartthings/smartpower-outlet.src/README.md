## Device Health

Check-in interval is double the value of maxReportTime. 
This gives the device twice the amount of time to respond before it is marked as offline.
Check-in interval = 12 mins

## Troubleshooting

If the device doesn't pair when trying from the SmartThings mobile app, it is possible that the device is out of range.
