## Device Health

A Zigbee dimmer with maxReportTime of 5 mins.
Check-in interval is double the value of maxReportTime.
This gives the device twice the amount of time to respond before it is marked as offline.
Enrolls with default periodic reporting until newer 5 min interval is confirmed
It then enrolls the device with updated checkInterval i.e. 12 mins

## Troubleshooting

If the device doesn't pair when trying from the SmartThings mobile app, it is possible that the device is out of range.
Pairing needs to be tried again by placing the device closer to the hub.
