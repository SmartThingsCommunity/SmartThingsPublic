This gives the device twice the amount of time to respond before it is marked as offline.
Check-in interval = 12 mins

## Battery Specification

One CR2477 (for Samsung SmartThings Motion Sensor) / CR123A (SmartSense Motion Sensor) 3V battery is required.

## Troubleshooting

If the device doesn't pair when trying from the SmartThings mobile app, it is possible that the sensor is out of range.
Pairing needs to be tried again by placing the sensor closer to the hub.
