## Device Health

Aeon Minimote is a ZWave totally sleepy device and is marked offline only in the case when Hub is offline.

## Troubleshooting

If the device doesn't pair when trying from the SmartThings mobile app, it is possible that the sensor is out of range.
Pairing needs to be tried again by placing the sensor closer to the hub.
