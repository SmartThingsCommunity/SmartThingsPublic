# Z-Wave Repeater

Does (almost) literally nothing.

## Installation

This device handler recognizes the following Z-Wave repeaters:

  - Iris Smart Plug Z-Wave Repeater
  - Aeon Labs DSD37-ZWUS Repeater
  - Aeotec Range Extender 6
  - Vision Security Repeater ZR1202US
  - Vision Z-Wave Repeater
  - Remotec ZRP-100US / BW8140US Z-Wave Repeater

To initiate Z-Wave setup on an Iris Smart Plug, go to add a new Thing in the SmartThings app, then with the smart plug plugged in, press the power button 8 times in rapid succession.

Z-Wave repeaters will appear in the app with the primary function being Refresh, which effectively does nothing except query the device firmware version.
