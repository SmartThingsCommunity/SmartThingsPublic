# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Our community of developers is what put SmartThings on the map!

## How can I contribute?

### Improve documentation

As a user of the SmartApp SDK, you're the perfect candidate to help us improve our documentation. Error fixes, typo corrections, better explanations, more examples, etc. Open issues for things that could be improved – anything. Even improvements to this document.

### Give feedback on issues

We're always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker. It's a good opportunity to influence the future direction of this SDK.

### [Submitting an issue or feature request](../../issues/new/choose)

- Search the issue tracker before opening an issue
- Ensure you're using the latest version
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Include as much information as possible by filling out the issue template
- The more time you put into an issue, the more we will

### [Submitting a pull request](../../compare)

- Run `./gradlew preCommit` before committing changes to run various checks and
  update documentation.
- Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work.
- For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the community for feedback as soon as possible. Open a pull request as soon as you have done the minimum needed to demonstrate your idea. At this early stage, don't worry about making things perfect, or 100% complete. Add a `[WIP]` prefix to the title, and describe what you still need to do. This lets reviewers know not to nit-pick small details or point out improvements you already know you need to make.
- Don't include unrelated changes
- New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the pull request and commits
- Lint and test before submitting the pull request by running `$ npm test`
- Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request. Answer _why_ it's needed and provide use-cases.
- Make the pull request from a [topic branch](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Topic-Branches) (not master)
- You might be asked to do changes to your pull request. There's never a need to open another pull request – [just update the existing one.](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)

## Contributing to models and API methods

Since much of the code is auto-generated from Swagger specification files, any pull requests regarding the generated files will not be accepted and will be immediately closed.

## [Finding contributions to work on](../../labels/help%20wanted)

Look at the existing issues for areas of contribution. Searching for issues labeled `help wanted` would be a great place to start.
